# TensorflowClassification

## Description
This android project contains a sample application that is built to deploy TensorFlow models into the android app.

To make the best use of the tensoflow model in android, we make use of the camera in the android system to produce the frames that will be used to run the model for prediction.

With the recent announcement at Google I/O 2019, we make use of cameraX library along with TensorFlow Lite library to build the app.

## What is needed
1. Android Studio 3.3 and above.
2. A tensorflow model (in .tflite file) and a text file with all the labels if you want to deploy a custom model.

## To run the application
Open the project in Android Studio. You may run the application in the android emulator or deploy it into android and run the application.
